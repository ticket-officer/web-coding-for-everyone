# Drawing App

This is a simple interactive drawing game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can draw on a canvas element by clicking and dragging their mouse.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the page.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that adds interactivity to the drawing canvas.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ticket-officer/web-programming-for-everyone.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   cd web-programming-for-everyone/drawing-app
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to start the game.

### Don't forget to try creating a game of your own! 😄 👍 🚀

## Extra Challenge

Can you figure out how to add color to the drawing strokes?
